## Count words in parallel

![Parallel wordcount experiment graph](./images/parallel-wordcount.png)

A Beaker experiment may contain multiple tasks.
A task may depend on the results of another task in its experiment.
In this example, the `merge` task depends on the results of the `count-1`, `count-2`, and `count-3` tasks.
The count tasks are executed in parallel and the merge task runs automatically once they complete.

This example uses two images:
1. `examples/wordcount`: Counts all words in the `/input` directory and produces a `word_count` metric.
2. `examples/merge-wordcount`: Sums the `word_count` metrics in the `/input` directory.

To run an experiment with multiple tasks, you must define an experiment specification in YAML.
The full spec is available [here](./parallel-wordcount.yml).

```yaml
version: v2-alpha
description: Parallel wordcount
# ...
```

Run the experiment using `beaker experiment create`:

```
â–¶ beaker experiment create -f parallel-wordcount.yaml
Experiment ex_k6biwrvfcgbu submitted. See progress at http://beaker.allenai.org/ex/ex_k6biwrvfcgbu
